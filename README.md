# Tiny-Webserver-and-Network-Communication-Project-
Using socket programming, we implemented a TCP client and server application in python.
Designed and implemented a custom web server in Python capable of handling HTTP requests (HTML, CSS, JPG, PNG files) and returning appropriate responses.

Developed client-server communication using sockets, supporting both text and binary data transfer.

Implemented features like 307 Temporary Redirect, 404 Error Handling, and basic screen-locking mechanisms for client verification.

Analyzed and captured DNS traffic using Wireshark, and utilized network commands like ping, tracert, nslookup, and telnet for diagnostics.

Built responsive HTML pages with student profiles and links to external resources.

Focused on content-type handling, dynamic webpage creation, and basic server-side programming concepts.
